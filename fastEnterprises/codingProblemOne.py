# Write a function that takes in a string, s, and returns the amount of 'a' in the string.
# There is a second input, x, that tells you how many characters to go up to. 
# If x is greater than the length of s, go back through s up until you reach x characters.

# I.e 
# s = "abca", x = 3
# The correct answer here is 1.
# s = "abca", x = 9
# The correct answer is 5. s in this instance s "abcaabcaa"
